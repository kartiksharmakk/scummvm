 *
 * This function merges the contents of extension into base by overwriting
 * any properties that exist in both objects with the values from extension.
 * Properties that don't exist in extension will be left unchanged in base.
 *
 * base and extension must be structurally equivalent. This means:
 *
 *   * if a property in one of the two is an object or array, it must also be
 *     an object or array in the other JSON tree, respectively.
 *   * if a property is an array, it must have the same number of elements in
 *     both JSON trees.
